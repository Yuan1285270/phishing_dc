# 🛡️ phishing_dc

A small project / toolkit for detecting phishing (domains, URLs, or emails) using data-driven techniques and machine learning.  
This repo contains code for feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and a simple inference interface.

## 💡 Project Overview

`phishing_dc` (phishing detection/classification) is intended as a research / educational project that demonstrates how to build a machine-learning pipeline to identify likely phishing samples from legitimate ones.  
It includes scripts for preprocessing, feature extraction, training models, and running inference locally.

> ⚠️ **Ethics & Responsible Use:** This project is for defensive and research purposes only. Do **not** use these tools to launch attacks, scrape private data, or otherwise engage in illegal or harmful behavior. Always follow local laws and institutional policies.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔎 Feature extraction for URLs/domains/emails (tokenization, length-based, lexical features, etc.)  
- 🤖 Model training scripts (classifiers such as Logistic Regression / Random Forest / LightGBM — or placeholders to plug your own)  
- 📈 Evaluation utilities (confusion matrix, precision/recall, ROC)  
- 🧪 Simple inference script for predicting a single URL/domain/email  
- 🗂️ Modular structure so components are easy to extend
